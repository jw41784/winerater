- Implemented OAuth 2.0 with automatic token refresh
- Created beautiful modal-based auth UI
- Added account linking for existing users
- Implemented "Remember Me" functionality


## Future Enhancements
- Wine recommendation system based on user preferences and previous ratings
- Editing functionality for existing wines
- Tags/categories for better organization and filtering
- Social sharing capabilities for wine recommendations
- Dark mode support with theme persistence
- Wine image compression for better performance and storage efficiency
- Offline-first enhancements for reliable use without connectivity
- Advanced statistics and insights based on user's collection
- Barcode/label scanning for easy wine entry
- Integration with external wine databases for additional information

## Authentication Fixed (December 2024)

### Issues Resolved
1. **Multiple conflicting auth scripts** - Removed duplicate scripts (google-auth-fix.js, auth-complete-fix.js, modern-ui-fix.js)
2. **WineRater.showToast not found** - Added showToast helper method to Auth object
3. **Auth object not globally accessible** - Added `window.Auth = Auth;` to auth.js
4. **Firebase file:// protocol issue** - Created local server (server.js) as Firebase requires HTTP/HTTPS
5. **Floating Google icon** - Completely rebuilt button via JavaScript to prevent icon injection
6. **Auth state transition** - Fixed timing issues and added proper error handling

### Current Implementation
- **Local Development**: Must use `npm start` to run local server (http://localhost:8080)
- **Authentication Flow**: Google sign-in popup → Firebase auth → onAuthStateChanged → UI transition
- **Button Creation**: Dynamic JavaScript creation in auth.js to ensure clean implementation
- **Override Script**: override-google-button.js ensures button stays clean and centered

### Files Added/Modified
- `server.js` - Simple HTTP server for local development
- `LOCAL_SETUP.md` - Documentation for running locally
- `override-google-button.js` - Ensures Google button has no icons and is centered
- `auth.js` - Fixed showToast issue, made Auth global, improved error handling
- `index.html` - Removed conflicting scripts, uses button container instead of static HTML

### Running Locally
```bash
npm install  # First time only
npm start    # Starts server on http://localhost:8080
```

**Important**: Do not open index.html as file:// - Firebase authentication will not work.
